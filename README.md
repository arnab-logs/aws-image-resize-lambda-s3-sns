# aws-image-resize-lambda-s3-sns
This project automates image resizing using AWS Serverless services. When a user uploads an image to the source S3 bucket, an AWS Lambda function resizes the image and stores the resized copy in a destination S3 bucket. A notification email is then sent using Amazon SNS.
